# Symbolic-Tensor-manipulation
This is a student project that performs different tensor operations. The operation to perform are written in a symbolic matter. Some of these operations are:  scalar contraction between indeces, standard matrix multiplication, or outer product between indeces. This library was developed with relativity equation manipulation in mind.
